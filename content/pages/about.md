## It all started with a BLT. 

I was living in NYC in 2007 and loved food, but didn't really cook for myself. After a late night with too much fun, I decided that I wanted a BLT. I followed recipes that I grew up with and those BLTs were a bit plain. Something clicked that night and I wanted something more. I swapped out the romaine for arugula, added marinated heirloom tomatoes and avocado. With one bite, I was changed. I realized I could make what I wanted and I haven't looked back since.

### Signature Dish

If I had to pick one dish, I would say a simple roast chicken and a loaf of sourdough. It makes your home smell like heaven. If you are able to save some of the chicken, the leftovers are wonderful for soups, pot pie and other easy weekday meals. My husband has admitted that sometimes he looks forward to a roast chicken because of the leftover meals. He's a sucker for a chicken pot pie!
