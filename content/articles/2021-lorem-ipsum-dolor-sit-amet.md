###### If you’ve got hardy greens in your fridge that aren’t getting any younger, blanch and then blend them into a silky-smooth purée that enlivens a simple bowl of beans (you can use this trick to green-ify any brothy soup, FYI). This recipe calls for kale but is meant to help you make use of whatever greens you’ve got, from Swiss chard to spinach to herbs that are a bit over-the-hill.

## Ingredients

* 3 Tbsp. raw pistachios, walnuts, or almonds
* 1 bunch kale
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 2 medium leeks, white and pale green parts only, tough outer layers removed, sliced into ½"-thick rounds
* 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* 4 oil-packed anchovy fillets
* Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
* 1 2"-wide strip lemon zest
* ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
* 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 15-oz. cans large white beans, (such as butter or cannellini), rinsed
* 1 cup chopped parsley
* 2 oz. feta, broken into large pieces
* 4 1"-thick slices country-style bread, toasted (for serving; optional)

My broth did not get as beautifully pureed as shown in the photos on Bon Appetit, but it was still absolutely delightful. Fresh, tasty spring dinner. Don't forget the toast and extra feta!

## Instructions

### Step 1

Toast pistachios in a dry small skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown in spots, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool; coarsely chop.

### Step 2

Remove ribs and stems from kale leaves. Finely chop ribs and stems; keep separated from leaves. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large pot over medium. Add leeks, garlic, anchovies, and kale ribs and stems; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are slightly softened, about 4 minutes. Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes and stir a few times to combine. Pour broth into pot, increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer.

### Step 3

Reduce heat to medium-low, add beans and crush a few with a wooden spoon to make the soup more creamy. Let simmer 10 minutes, then stir in kale leaves and cook until just wilted, about 2 minutes. Remove soup from heat.

### Step 4

Using a slotted spoon, transfer kale leaves to a blender and add parsley and pistachios. Pour 1 cup broth (some beans are fine) from soup into blender and purée until smooth. Pour kale purée into pot with soup and stir to combine. Taste soup and season with more salt if needed.

### Step 5

Ladle soup into bowls; top with feta and drizzle with oil. Serve with toast.
